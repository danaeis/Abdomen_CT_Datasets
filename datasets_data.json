Additionally, because pathologic and radiographic alterations of the non-tumoral liver parenchyma caused by hepatic artery infusion (HAI) of chemotherapy are not well described, any patient who received preoperative HAI was excluded. Finally, to obtain the most accurate FLR 3D-model, patients who underwent either local tumor ablation, more than 3 wedge resections in the FLR, or had no visible tumor on preoperative imaging were excluded.

A 3D model was generated using Scout Liver (Pathfinder Technologies Inc., TN, USA). The performed liver resection was virtually drawn on the 3D model of the liver. Transection lines to generate the FLR were based on postoperative imaging and/or resection margin width from pathology analysis.\nThe masks corresponding to the segmentations of the liver, tumor(s), hepatic and portal vessels, along with the FLR were initially saved in the ITK MetaImage format (https://itk.org/Wiki/ITK/MetaIO), and converted to DICOM segmentation objects (DSO), in accordance with the Segmentation Information Object Definition, as specified in PS3.3: DICOM Information Object Definitions in the DICOM standard23, using the 3D Slicer python API (https://www.slicer.org). The following Slicer extensions were utilized during the conversion process: SlicerDevelopmentToolbox, DCMQI, PETDICOMExtension, QuantitativeReporting.\nThe segmentations of the liver, tumors, and vessels were produced semi-automatically using standard image processing and software (Scout Liver, Pathfinder Technologies Inc., TN, USA) and were conducted by an expert radiologist or fellow. Post-operative imaging and/or resection margin width was used to virtually draw the performed liver resection on the preoperative 3D model of the liver, to derive the FLR. The DICOM segmentation property codes for all segmentations were set based on standard SNOMED CT codes (https://www.snomed.org/). In particular, the FLR property code was assigned using a combination of SNOMED codes for “Liver” and “Residual”.",

U-Net was used for initial development of the segmentation based on the existing segmentations. Junior annotators then randomly revised 100 of the CTs, which were then confirmed by senior radiologists. This process was iterated seven times until all the images were labeled by one of the junior annotators and further refined by the senior radiologists. The last step aimed to identify potential annotation errors. We trained a new set of U-Net models using five-fold cross-validation, with special attention given to images exhibiting low DSC scores (≤0·75), which were then manually double-checked and refined by the senior radiologists.\n\n In the training set, the lesion annotations in the source datasets were directly used. In the tuning and testing set, all visible lesions were annotated by a senior radiologist with the assistance of ITK-SNAP and MedSAM.",

All generated annotations were manually reviewed and corrected by human readers using ITK SNAP on every fifth axial slice while other slices were set to an ignore label (numeric value 255).\nDuring the annotation process, a quality control team consisting of senior annotators, a data scientist, and a senior radiologist with 7 years of experience in abdominal imaging, refined and reviewed segmentations first manually and afterward automatically. Manual quality control was mainly based on the experience of the human readers and the internal annotation guidelines. The automatic quality control implemented a few test cases regarding the presence or absence of labels, unusual instance counts for a specific label or neighbor label constraints.",
